This repository includes examples of work for my master's research.  The project involves using the reaction-diffusion equation to model tumor growth, with mechanical forces accounted for through additional equations. Currently, only linear elastic deformations are accounted for, and we are trying to extend the model to allow for nonlinearities in stiffness and deformations. This repository contains modeling files for fenics.
