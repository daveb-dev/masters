** TODO
Model
O Verify parameter estimation capability using synthetic data: Use forward model with pre-selected parameters, then run parameter estimation and see how close
  - Nonlinear
O Run model faster
   - Fewer time steps
   - Lower tolerance 
O Validate reaction diffusion (use masa?)
   - Want to see what a finer mesh/different time step does? This should show error convergence?
O Validate LE and HE (again, use manufactured solution?)
O Validate parameter estimation 
O Fix boundary condition to allow movement along skull 
O Need to check if there is an optimal mesh/time step
O Why is carrying capacity not reached in data?
O Need to test different cases of regularization with L curve
O Use actual deformations? Ask David
O Fix nonlinear solver not converging - trying explicit Euler didn't work, keep working on the math
O Which other nonlinear models should we test?
O Maybe try a different solver than LBFGS later

Report
O Need to write about validation for appendix
O Change mesh picture in report? Might be wrong picture, shows coarse mesh in some places. 
O In images of tumor, include bar for scale of mm
O Need to fix figures for report - normalize correctly in paraview, include time points in figure caption, make a point in the caption about what's happening, make better montages

** Completed items
* Verify parameter estimation capability using synthetic data: Use forward model with pre-selected parameters, then run parameter estimation and see how close
  - Linear
* Run model faster
   - Separate tumor and brain mesh when possible, and have coarser brain mesh
* Fixed meshing matlab program to work for rats 06, 09, 12 that have tumors outside skull. Used a single mesh since program interpolates actual data onto mesh well
* Growth field should be a function of time, but we're not modeling here
* Ignored AIC for now, simply base model comparison on which fits data better
* Tried making growth field related to stress (stresses are capable of increasing pressure and reducing flow according to a source I had read) but ultimately decided not to 
* Tried estimating for a D field as well, but decided diffusion should not be a local parameter, except maybe local to different regions of the brain (David said even then it doesn't change much)
* Tried different cost functions; considered minimizing gradient at tumor boundary using Tikhonov regularization
* Ran "sensitivity" analysis to see when nonlinear solver fails
* Changed code lots along the way; put everything together in one python code, allowed it to take input and run, tried to fix parameters for solvers
* Ran parameter estimation several times in different ways and then used the parameters estimated for forward model
* Xinzeng said to save strain, stress, E^S, E^G
* Changed von Mises criterion for 2D
* Obtained mechanical values from Xinzeng/David's paper
* Used carrying capacity from David's paper - he calculated packing fraction of cells in a square
* Increased time step to reduce solving time
* Added time function to see how long runs are taking 
* Asked David about pixel size - forgot why, it's .25x.25x1mm
* Asked David why rat 12 has more cells - forgot why
* Saved rat forward model as a movie file
* Asked David about which objective function he used, forgot; he may have used difference in area, also used DICE
* Sent intro draft to Tom
* Made finer mesh for tumor
* Interpolated mesh on skull boundary for finer mesh (custom function)
* Asked David why rat 6 time 5 - forgot why
* Installed dolfin-adjoint, couldn't get it to work with the installed version of Fenics on laptop. Spent a bunch of time trying to get it to work and finally used Python2.7, pip, pyadjoint. Should've taken more notes on this
* Changed hyperelastic formulation to Danial's because we need to compare beta values? Need to check this
* Spent a ton of time trying to get Paraview to work in linux subsystem by building and doing a ton of stuff but ended up installing on Windows which was far easier
* Debated whether we should try to find a "mean" tumor growth for model, but ended up calibrating for different rats
* Ignored rats 06, 09, and 12 because tumor presence outside the skull
* Decided to use rat 05 for testing since it showed the least amount of necrosis
* Cleaned up figures - labeled axes, clarified titles, clarified colorbar, used bone colormap, used montage function in matlab, larger fonts, removed titles when using caption
* Followed similar procedure for creating tumor outline and mesh
* Discretized the boundary further and used Xinzeng's meshing files to mesh the brain slice
* Plotted the skull in Matlab and used a boundary function to get outline
* Considered minimizing difference in area or difference in celullarity
* Considered AIC: Akaike Information Criterion for model comparison
* Plotted tumor area and "volume" (voxels with tumor cell count > 0) over time
* Plotted tumor data in various slices
* Received tumor imaging data from David
* Wrote RD, LE, HE and functions that can be moved around easily (originally saved in different files and imported, then aggregated into a single file)
* Saved all output into one file
* Used warp by vector tool to visualize displacement
* Output stress and displacement tensors to XDMF files for viewing in paraview
* Compared HE and LE models for beam under varying levels of uniaxial tension, plotted LE linear response vs HE softening response
* Tested hyperelastic formulation with beam under uniaxial tension, got similar results for low stresses
* Wrote hyperelastic formulation in fenics, using the energy minimization problem and Neo-Hookean stored energy model
* Found hyperelastic formulation in fenics documentation
* Ran LE notebook of plane strain with uniaxial tension, compared to analytical solution and got same answer
* Used airy stress function for analytical solution of beam under uniaxial tension
* Found potential analytical solution for a plane strain problem with beam from elasticity book
* Included boundary condition of zero displacement for LE
* Cleaned up formulation documentation of LE and RD
* Implemented plane strain formulation
* Wrote out plane strain and plane stress formulations for better understanding of simplifying assumptions
* Found 2D, plane strain formulation in elasticity book
* First try at LE FEM formulation from fenics book
* Checked RD formulation, rewrote for spatially varying D
* Tried to validate RD
* Plotted RD output in paraview with cross section (plot over line)
* Output RD data to paraview
* Implemented RD forward model in fenics
* First try at RD discrete model/FEM formulation
* Drafted TOC

??Errors
? "Since there are no variables in the expression [0, 0], it cannot be differentiated"
  ! in FIAT/expansions.py, form_derivative, change "except AttributeError" to "except(AttributeError, ValueError)"
? "functional should be a Functional"
  ! probably related to dolfin-adjoint installation. Need to install fenics 2017.2.0 from conda-forge, then pyadjoint 2017.2.0 from "pip install git+https://bitbucket.org/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint.git@2017.2.0". This will not show a pyadjoint package in "conda list" or "pip show pyadjoint" however, only the package dolfin-adjoint=0.0.1
